The Border Gateway Protocol is both critical to the successful interconnectivity
of the Internet and highly susceptible to attacks such as hijacking,
misconfigurations, black holes, and denial of service attacks. RPKI is the
proposed solution to this problem. I use the RouteViews BGP dataset combined
with RIPE NCC's RPKI dataset to analyze the trend of isolated BGP attacks and
distributed BGP attacks, purely from RouteViews's perspective.
